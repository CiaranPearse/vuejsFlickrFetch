# flickr-vuejs

> A Vue project to fetch the latest photos from Flickr based on tag input in batches of 20. When the user scrolls to the bottom of the page it loads the next 20 photos.

React Version here:
https://github.com/CiaranPearse/reactjsFlickrFetch

## Frontend Template
I've used Vuetify as a frontend Template. The main reasons for this were for the grid, input fields and cards. Why reinvent the wheel?

I've decided to go with the Dark version of the template. Theres no real reason for this other than I want it to be the "one thats just that little bit different"


Im not fond of MasonryJs as it tends to give inconsistant & unpredictable layouts in most cases so for this version Ive gone with set heights on the images. (i.e. used the small square version of the image from Flickr)
The react version uses Masonry


## Tags
Since I didnt use Masonry I needed predictable height for each block. For this reason the first 3 tags are teimmed and displayed. If there are more than 3 tags a link will be shown with a menu for the remaining tags. These tags are clickable and return the user to the tag page in flickr.


## Infinate Scroll
Upon reaching the end of current loaded photos an API call will attempt to load the next batch or 20.

## Store Items

### loading: 
Bool - Sets initial loading state

### searchText: 
Contains the input from the search bar. If it is null then a message is shown

### photos:
Contains the photo object updated by the API call

### photoPage:
Contains the page number from the latest API response

### perPage:
Sets how many photos to get per API call

### hasError:
Bool - if true it is used to show an error div

### errorMsg:
Contains Error Message. If flickr returns a status of "fail" this will be populated from the response. If response is OK but yeilds 0 results it will be "No Photos found for TAG_NAME"
